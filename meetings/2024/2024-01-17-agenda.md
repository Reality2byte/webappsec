### Draft Agenda

* [Trusted Types](https://w3c.github.io/trusted-types/dist/spec/): @mozfreddyb will briefly discuss Mozilla's revised position on the feature, and point to some outstanding work that we should ensure happens.

* [`:visited` partitioning](https://github.com/kyraseevers/Partitioning-visited-links-history): @kyraseevers will discuss the current state of this proposal in Chromium, as well as any feedback the group can provide.

* CSP Maintenance: @bakkor pointed to some specific bugs against CSP, which highlights the broader problem that we're not doing a great job maintaining this feature. We should discuss our options.
